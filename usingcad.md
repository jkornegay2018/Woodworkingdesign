### I have not tried this method of design. This process requires a few more costly items, the most being a computer of course. The benefits of using this is simply for precesion work and the ability to see your work without making a smaller scale model. A majority of  
of woodworkers who use software use the application [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/3Dfor/woodworking). According to their website,
"They let you do what you want without having to figure out how. They help with hard or boring tasks so that you can focus on being creative, or productive, or both. And they are, in their own way, beautiful." *sketchup website*, 2018.
